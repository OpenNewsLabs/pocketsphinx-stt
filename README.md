## pocketsphinx-stt
Speech to text module initially [Video grep Mac OSX Electron app](https://github.com/antiboredom/videogrep), by Sam Lavine [@sam_lavigne](https://twitter.com/sam_lavigne)



Then refactored as part of [autoEdit](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2), and subsequently as part of [Digital Paper Edit](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-electron) app.

<!-- It uses Pocketshphinx and ffmpeg binaries for os x. To run on a linux server you'd need to get (or compile) those binaries for linux. -->


Pocketshphinx is set with American english dictionary.

## Setup
<!-- _stack - optional_
_How to build and run the code/app_ -->

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/pocketsphinx-stt
```

```
cd pocketsphinx-stt
```
```
npm install
```

## Usage

on npm [`pocketsphinx-stt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pocketsphinx-stt)

```
npm install pocketsphinx-stt
```


There are two options, one expect the file to be already an audio file that can work with pocketsphinx 

```js
const transcribe = require('pocketsphinx-stt').transcribe;
const videoFilePath = // some video file

transcribe(videoFilePath)
    .then((res) => {
        console.log('transcribe', res);
    })
```


While the other will use ffmpeg convert the audio or video file to the right format for pocketsphinx.
```js
const convertAndTranscribe = require('pocketsphinx-stt').convertAndTranscribe;
const videoFilePath = // some video file

convertAndTranscribe(videoFilePath)
    .then((res) => {
        console.log('transcribe', res);
    })
```

It can take an optional parameter to specifiy where you'd want to save the audio file, if not provided it saves it in the same folder as the original media, with same name but audio extension.

### Example output

Uses json format for transcript from [Digital Paper Edit](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-electron) project.
